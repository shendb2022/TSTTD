### TSTTD

Efficient replication for the paper: "Triplet Spectral-Wise Transformer Network for Hyperspectral Target Detection", TGRS, 2023.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11.0
- PyTorch 2.0
- NVIDIA TITAN RTX

### Demo

Demo for TSTTD

1. You can directly test the model on San Diego.

2. If you want to train it on other datasets, please change the state to "train" and modify the data path and number of bands.

3. After finishing training, you can change the state to "eval" to test.
